## Description

This guide is a tool used to help retain information learned throughout the prework assignment.

- I made this study guide so that I can take the first steps in being a profficient coder.
- It creates a more efficient place for me to review information I have learned thus far.
- I learned how to add HTML, CSS, and JS elements to my webpage as well as how to use GitHub to back up my work and create a feature branch to work on.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
